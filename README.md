Freaks n' Firepower is a mod for DRTC developed by Mezzelo.
This current version is updated for 2/14 VALENTINES DAY patch.  Future versions will probably not work, so don't try it unless you really want to!  This will NOT work on the test builds!
Also you should totally start new runs with this installed, you can NOT find new special characters, traders, or events on old runs.

Installation:
note - I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND doing a clean re-install of DRTC before installing the mod if you have installed previous versions of the mod.

PC - Just drag and drop all of the above folders from the .zip file directly into the game's root folder (Program files x86/steam/steamapps/common/Death Road to Canada).  That's it.
Mac
1. Make a folder called DR2C on your desktop. Locate and make a copy of DR2C.app. Steam makes this pretty easy. Command-click the game in your list of games, click Properties, go the the Local Files tab and click Browse Local Files. Copy and paste the only file in the finder window that appears (should be DR2C.app but the ".app" part may be hidden which is fine) to the aforementioned DR2C folder on your desktop.
2. Create a folder called Mod on your desktop and place inside it the data, deathforth, and gfx folders from the Freaks and Firearms zip file.
3. Run Terminal, copy and paste the following command
"cp -pRv ~/Desktop/Mod/ ~/Desktop/DR2C/DR2C.app/Contents/Resources"
and then press return.
4. If everything worked properly, you should be able to run the modded game from the DR2C folder on your desktop. You can put it wherever you want, rename it, etc at this point. Play the unmodified game with Steam as usual.

If you find any bugs, please PM me over Discord (mezzelo #9629) or Reddit (/u/Mezzelo) or leave a comment on the itch.io page (mezzelo.itch.io/drtc-fnf) and I'll try to get back to you.

- Fixed pyro not giving charm shotgun shells with flame shotgun
- Fixed pyro selling four flame shotguns
- Fixed some trades not having sounds

CHANGELOG: FNF Update 4.5 (Build 11) - DUODENUM HOTFIX (8/6-8?) COMPATIBLE

- Seven new weapons!
	- Quad rocket launcher: Four shots that explode on impact.
	- PANZERPOOT: Single shot launcher.  Messes up everything in a large radius, but isn't entirely reliable!
	- Vintage machine gun: Rapid-fire machine gun, even faster than a minigun but with weaker shots.
	- Flame shotgun: Short-ranged fire-lighting apparatus, uses shotgun shells and spits out flames.
	- Quad laser: Three enormous bullets which you cannot jump over. Obliterates everything in its path: Zombies, trees, cars, and people too.
	- Comically oversized pistol: Huge gun with big bullets, destroys zombies but limited capacity.
	- Incendiary grenade: Larger fire on a longer fuse.
	
- Two new traders
	- Demolitionist: Sells things that explode in varying intensities.
	- Pyromaniac: Sells things that make fire.
	
- Fixed bug causing shotgun trader to not have his shotgun out
- Pyro now exists as a merchant rather than a recruitable character as the fireproof guy is already a thing
- Fixed bug causing nick and marty to not ditch the group if the other died

- Major rebalancing for existing weapons.
	- Full-auto shotgun buffed considerably, price raised. It's slightly stronger than a normal shotgun per shot 
		but if you can afford it I guess that's a bit irrelevant, balance be damned.
	- Machine pistol, super machine pistol and vintage SMG buffed all-around
		- Changed the name of the Vintage SMG to the more iconic "Timmy gun"
	- Sniper rifle ROF slowed down by 0.5 secs
	- Flare gun buffed to last longer and to emit a large light, making it actually useful for lighting rooms up
	- Price raised for the DINNER LUNCHER, museum DINNER LUNCHER spawn given a 50% chance and comes with much less food.
	- Portable grenade launcher shots are stronger, blow up on hitting walls, and are no longer slowed down by zombies, making for far more consistent shots
	
- Trader stock changed around again to fit in new guns
	- Bullpup carbine and LEVERDAWG no longer obtainable, they didn't have much of a place in the scheme of weapon variety.
	- Pistol and special guns traders have new unique sprites, special guns trader sells the quad laser and comically oversized pistol instead
	
	- Fixed bug causing shotgun trader to not have his weapon out.
	- Fixed price bugs and traders giving weird things for charm bonuses.
		- Charm bonuses added to all modded traders where applicable
		
- Three new exhibits for the museum: HOT THINGS WITH HOT FIRES, THINGS THAT GO BOOM, and YE OLDE GUNS OF YE OLDE WARS
- Old exhibits modified to incorporate mod weapons with better balance

- Three new characters, nine new weapons!
	- Steve Ray Gun: Bleach drinker extraordinare.
	- Joke Logan: Leader of the strongest army out there.
	- Dick Compton: Canada's his state.
	(I REALLY want to add more, but the game can't support much more right now without some major bodge
	Stay tuned for next vanilla patch)
	
	- Repeater rifle: The true cowboy rifle, shoot down zombies with speed and style.
	- Flare-gun: Use it to light up a room, or a horde.
	- Portable grenade launcher: Carries two high-powered shots. Aim into a horde for maximum effect.
	- DINNER LUNCHER: Fires a huge spread of zombie-wrecking carnage, but consumes food!
	
	- Bleach: You can't drink it, but you can chuck it at zombies.
	- Bleach Lite: A melee variant used for splashing onto zombies.
	
	- Diamond sword: Surprisingly ineffective, but it won't break. 
	- Bonecrusher mace/shield: Usable only by true knights and violent day-trading sociopaths.
	
	
- Major changes to existing characters
	- Peg-legs removed, antiquated due to vanilla captain recruit.
	- Plague doctor now cannot drop her bombs as per support given in DUODENUM update.
		- Robbing her also gives plague and stun grenades, with some scalpels to boot.
		- also fixed her not having her knife
	- Cuff Breaker can now pick up zombies/furniture, and screams while smacking zombies down with it.
	- Tom Bender now comes with the bonecrusher mace/shield set rather than the generic katana, cannot hold items, has +1 vitality, and is road-recruited.

	- Becca now turns into a SPOOKY GHOST when stung by a bee.
	- Drifter's guns now use internal charges that regenerate after each location.
	
	- Juan Beag and Ferdinand no longer harve blurbs to accomodate new updates. Hopefully this'll be fixed soon.
	
	- Character recruit events added into the correct pools:  Mr. Upfront, Pardue and Chad count as "bad" characters.
