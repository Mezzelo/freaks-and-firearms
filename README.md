FIREARMS NAE FREAKS, BUILD 1: THE SPRING BR8K UPD8

- 21 new conventional firearms, available for purchase and added into location spawns.
- 11 new specialty firearms, including explosive launchers and power tools.
- 16 new melee weapons, including drops from furniture/skeletons and MORE POWER TOOLS.
- 6 new throwable weapons, involving horde-fighting utilities, things that light on fire, and SPORTS.

- 12 new weapon traders, doubling the vanilla count of weapon traders!

Weapon and trader distribution is carefully balanced: New weapons will appear as less common sidegrade choices/drops, without changing the vanilla ratio of ranged/melee and supply or training/weapon traders.

Some traders will randomly sell one of two weapon types instead of always offering a certain option.  This is randomized per-run and alternates when encountering the trader again.

------------- INSTALLATION ----------------

PC - Just drag and drop all of the above folders from the .zip file directly into the game's root folder (Program files x86/steam/steamapps/common/Death Road to Canada, or wherever u got it).  Overwrite files where prompted.  That's it.
Mac
1. Make a folder called DR2C on your desktop. Locate and make a copy of DR2C.app. Steam makes this pretty easy. Command-click the game in your list of games, click Properties, go the the Local Files tab and click Browse Local Files. Copy and paste the only file in the finder window that appears (should be DR2C.app but the ".app" part may be hidden which is fine) to the aforementioned DR2C folder on your desktop.
2. Create a folder called Mod on your desktop and place inside it the data, deathforth, and gfx folders from the Freaks and Firearms zip file.
3. Run Terminal, copy and paste the following command
"cp -pRv ~/Desktop/Mod/ ~/Desktop/DR2C/DR2C.app/Contents/Resources"
and then press return.
4. If everything worked properly, you should be able to run the modded game from the DR2C folder on your desktop. You can put it wherever you want, rename it, etc at this point. Play the unmodified game with Steam as usual.

If you find any bugs, please let me know through Reddit (/u/mezzelo), Discord (Mezzelo #9629) or Steam (https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mezzelo/).

KNOWN COMPATIBLE MODS
- K Smith Modpack

KNOWN INCOMPATIBLE MODS
- DRTC: High Road
- Pyromaniac Mod
- extensive trait mod
- there's not a whole lot of mods lol.  anything that modifies weapons won't fly w/out manual patching.

Unfortunately, the 54 additional weapons pushes the game past the limit of location-spawnable items.  Mods that add weapons into location generation will require much more delicate patching.
